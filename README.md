## Individual hack day!

This is my project for the hack day at SALT: the result of an entire day of individual work. The intructions we had to follow are listed below.  

I choosed to do do a project with React to search for books based on Goodreads API. I used Express on the backend and bootstrap to help with the css. 



### Instructions:

You are supposed to code something on your own. It is OK to find inspiration from sources online as long as the end result is something unique. Making a carbon copy (or a copy with minimal changes) is __not__ OK.

Remember that you should scope it in a way that you think you can complete this in one day.

You are allowed to use any techniques that we have used so far in this course. It is not necessary to build a fullstack application, you may focus on only the frontend or backend. If you want to explore something new, talk to us first.

If your main focus is about the graphical interface, user interaction and UX, we kindly ask you to stay away from Twitter Bootstrap.

If you want to co-operate in pairs and build one part each of a larger application, come talk to us first. Pair programming is not allowed in this exercise, but we might be able to find a solution if you have a really good idea that can be clearly separated into two parts.

Create a new branch named after yourself and work in this. In the event you have a code base or dev environment you want to start out with, you __need__ to check this in before you start.

__VERY important__: Push your solutions to GitHub on a regular basis. As soon as you have something new that works - commit with a descriptive comment and push! Before you go home for the day, push everything you got.

__VERY VERY important__: You need to have something to present. It is not acceptable to have a non-working half-measure of an application just because you didn't scope properly. The key to not ending up in this situation is to work agile - take small steps, have something that actually works early in the game.

### Presentation
Everyone will get to present their work in front of part of the class. This will take place during Friday. You will have 7 minutes each, including 1 minute Q&A!

We are looking forward to see what amazing things you come up with!
